Arrays

- C# arrays allow you to store sequences of values in a single data structure
- They are declared using the variable type followed by [] to indicate an array
- Once you have a single variable that stores all the values, you can sort the values, reverse the order of the values, loop through each value and inspect it individually
- Arrays can be used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable
- Arrays require an instance

- The data type attributed when the instance is declared must match the data type assigned
      string[] fraudulentOrderIDs = new string[3];
      fraudulentOrderIDs[0] = "A123";
      fraudulentOrderIDs[1] = "B456";
      fraudulentOrderIDs[2] = "C789";

Foreach Statement
- The foreach statement provides a simple, clean way to iterate through the elements of an array
- The foreach statement processes array elements in increasing index order, starting with index 0 and ending with index Length - 1
- It uses a temporary variable to hold the value of the array element associated with the current iteration
