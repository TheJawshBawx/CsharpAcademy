.Net Libraries

A class is basically a container for methods
 - For example the system.console class contains the method .WriteLine()
 - Math is a class with a number of different methods such as math.Random()
 - Data types are also present in classes in the .NET Class Library

Calling from a class library involves these steps
 - Typing the class name - "Console"
 - Member access operator - "."
 - Method name - "WriteLine
 - Method invocation operator - "()"
 - Specify arguments - ("string argument")

Stateful VS Stateless methods
 - State is a condition of the execution environment at a specific moment in time
 - Stateless methods do not rely on data or variables stored in memory
    - Console.WriteLine() does not rely on any pre existing data 
    - Random.Next() requires data stored in memory or they modify the state of data as an instance.
      .Next requires an instance of Random to exist
    - This instance is called an object

Objects / Instances
 - To create an object or an instance, you use the 'new' operator
    - This creates a new object with a memory address for information to be stored

Return Values
 - Some methods end their function without returning anything. These are called void methods
 - You can return the value with or without storing it in a variable
    - int roll = dice.Next() vs Console.Writeline(dice.Next())

Input Parameters 
 - Information consumed by the method is called a parameter
    - .Next(1, 7) the 1 and 7 are parameters required by the method

Overloaded Methods
 - An overloaded method is defined with multiple method signatures
    - Console.Writeline() accepts 19 different types of data. Int, Str, zero, etc
